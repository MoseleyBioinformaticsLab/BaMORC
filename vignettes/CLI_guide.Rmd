# BaMORC Command Line Interface (CLI) guide

This document describes each command line function built into the `BaMORC` package.

## Over all CLI design

CLIs vary widely. Before diving into the actual command, it is important to understand the general pattern of the CLI commands so that you can construct a complete and coherent command for utilizing `BaMORC` functions.

The key features of any CLI is the structure of the command. A CLI consists of the following patterns:

1. Language interpreter,
2. A script for doing something,
3. Arguments needed for the script to execute.

You need to be able to construct a command with these components in order to perform the desired CLI call.

`BaMORC` supports two type of CLI calls: innate `R CMD BATCH`, which supports all OS platforms, and Linux CLI. 

### Linux CLI

To use "BaMORC CLI", you need to find the CLI run-script. Open terminal and type the following code:
```
> R -e 'system.file("exec", "bamorc.R", package = "BaMORC")'
```

You will see the R script location printed out in the terminal as shown in following image.

The standard Linux CLI follows the `Docopt` convention. 

CLI syntex: `bamorc.R <job> <arguments>`


#### The available tasks in the Linux CLI
Following job can be used:

* `assigned`: calculate the reference correction value for assigned carbon-13 protein NMR spectra.
* `unassigned`: calculate the reference correction value for unassigned carbon-13 protein NMR spectra.
* `valid_ids`: print out all the valid BMRB entry IDs.

Valid CLI commands are described below. We will explain the arguments in next session.

* For assigned carbon-13 protein NMR spectra:

        bamorc.R assigned   (--table=<csv> | --bmrb=<bmrb> | --id=<id>)  [--ppm_range=<range>] [--output=<output_filename>] [--delimiter=<delim>] [--report=<report_filename>]
        
* For assigned carbon-13 protein NMR spectra:

        bamorc.R unassigned (--table=<csv>) (--seq=<sequence>) [--ppm_range=<range>] [--output=<output_filename>] [--delimiter=<delim>] [--report=<report_filename>] [--ssc=<path>]
        
* For printing out all valid IDs:

        bamorc.R valid_ids

#### Argument syntax: please don't leave a space before or after the `=`.

The arguments are in `--` or `-` format, for example `--ppm_range=<value>` and `-h`. 

The helper commands are:
* `bamorc.R -h | --help`: print out this CLI help information.
* `bamorc.R -v | --version`: print out package version.

Other arguments are divided into required or optional:

* Required arguments for assigned protein NMR spectra referencing correction: `--table=<csv>` or `--bmrb=<bmrb>` or `--id=<id>`, just one of them.
   + `--table=<csv>`: Input file path (can be shortened as `-s=<csv>`)
   + `--bmrb`: file path of input BMRB file
   + `--id=<id>`: RefDB or BMRB ID. (can be shortened as `-i=<id>`)
   + `--seq=<sequence>`: Sequence of protein of interest, if protein sequence file is not provided. (Can be shortened as `-s=<sequence>`)

* Required arguments for unassigned protein NMR spectra referencing correction: `--table=<csv>` and `--seq=<sequence>`.
   + `--table=<csv>`: Input file path (can be shortened as `-s=<csv>`)
   + `--seq=<sequence>`: Sequence of protein of interest, if protein sequence file is not provided. (Can be shortened as `-s=<sequence>`)
   
* Optional arguments:

   + `--delimiter=<delim>`: Delimiter option can be 'comma', 'tab' and 'whitespace'. (Can be shortened as `-d=<delim>`)
   + `--ppm_range=<range>`: The ppm search range for reference correction value, default value is '-5,5'. (Can be shortened as `-p=<range>`)
   + `--output=<output_file_path>`: File path of the output from BaMORC result in csv format. (Can be shortened as `-o=<output_file_path>`)
   + `--ssc=<ssc_path>`: Spin system creater, default value is `moseleybioinformaticslab/ssc`. (Can be shortened as `-g=<ssc_path>`)
   + `--report=<report_file_path>`: Correction value report output file path. (Can be shortened as `-r=<report_file_path>`)

#### Examples:

```
> ./path-of-r-script/bamorc.R assigned --id=4020 --ppm_range=(-1,1) --output=./output/output.csv --report=./output/report.txt
```

```
> ./path-of-r-script/bamorc.R assigned --table=./input.csv --ppm_range=(-1,1) --output=./output/output.csv --report=./output/report.txt
```

```
> ./path-of-r-script/bamorc.R unassigned --table=./input.csv --seq=GSIPCLLSPWSEWSDCSVTCGKGMRTRQRMLKSLAELGDCNEDLEQAEKCMLPECP --ppm_range=(-1,1) --output=./output/output.csv --report=./output/report.txt
```


### R CMD BATCH (Windows-friendly) <Will be included in next version!>

R language has its own CLI command pattern via the functionality of `R CMD BATCH`. At the very beginning of R history, `R CMD BATCH` was the function handle all the non-interactive calls through the shell. 

   The patters is simple: `R CMD BATCH [arguments-to-pass] [path-of-script.R] $` 
   
Here arguments are in the `-` format, for example `-ppm_range=<value>`.
